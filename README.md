### I am super close!

I am very close to creating a working interpreter for To The Top Right Corner! Everything works except the starting point of the grid and the proper directions! I could definitely fix directions easily but I really would like to fix starting point first.

### What is this?

This is a attempted/attempting interpreter for To The Top Right Corner, a esolang concept. 

### How it should be

The language uses a 5 by 5 grid to select characters, the interpreter I plan on creating will be a bit different as the esolangs page did not specify all the information I needed.
